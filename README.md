# React Static CMS

This is the seed of a React Static project powered by NetlifyCMS.
It builds upon [react-static netlifycms example](https://github.com/nozzle/react-static/tree/master/examples/netlifycms) with these modifications :

* supports Sass with PostCSS
* configures NetlifyCMS in `src-admin/index.js` to use your components and stylesheet for the preview panel

Configuration of the backend is done in `src-admin/config.yml`
